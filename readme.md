# Motivation
There are two controller for the playing the video, but they are not customizable. This package tries to be as flexible as possible, and provide better controll over the video and other components beside the video.

# Features
* fullscreen mode will auto rotate the screen.( also rotation will trigger fullscreen mode).
* use custom components for play/pause/error/loading state of the player.
  
# Peer Dependencies
this libarary depends on:

* `react-native-reanimated` if using the default slider.
* `react-native-gesture-handler` if using the default slider.
* `react-native-orientation` to handle rotations.
* `react-native-video` to play videos.
  

make sure install and link these packages.
